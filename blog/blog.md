## R3 - Reflection
> Article: Algorithmic Profiling of Job Seekers in Austria: How Austerity Politics Are Made Effective

### üó®Ô∏è&nbsp; "How does the article inform your understanding of human centered data science?"  
AMS would like to use an algorithm to evaluate job opportunities for the unemployed. For this, various variables are taken into account when assessing job opportunities, including gender. But also various other variables are criticized, e.g. to what extent the economic environment is taken into account.
One of the main problems is transparency, which, according to the paper, is not fully available.
From a human-centered perspective, the algorithm does poorly, because variables such as gender can produce discriminatory results, in addition there is also not much transparency. The algorithm is not an objective program, many value judgments and evaluations that should be discussed socially have been incorporated.

### ‚ùì&nbsp; Questions

1. How can we prevent such a bias? When is system transparent enough?
2. Ethic comes from humans and not from machines. How can you check if data is biased? Can a data set ever be evaluated without prejudice so that there is no discrimination?

### Reflections and implications

Write about `350` words, reflecting on what you have learned, what you found, what (if anything) surprised üò≤ you about your findings, and/or what theories you have about why any biases might exist (if you find they exist). Please also include any questions this assignment raised for you about bias, Wikipedia, or machine learning.

_Your 350 words_

1. _Your question 1?_
1. _Your question 2?_

### Questions

Pleas answer the following questions with at least 2-3 sentences each.

1. What biases did you expect to find in the data (before you started working with it), and why?
    * _answer_
1. What (potential) sources of bias did you discover or introduce during data processing and analysis?
    * _answer_
1. What might your results suggest about (English) Wikipedia as a data source?
    * _answer_
1. What might your results suggest about the internet and global society in general?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might create biased or misleading results, due to the inherent gaps and limitations of the data?
    * _answer_
1. Can you think of a realistic data science research situation where using these data (to train a model, perform a hypothesis-driven research, or make business decisions) might still be appropriate and useful, despite its inherent limitations and biases?
    * _answer_
1. How might a researcher supplement or transform this dataset to potentially correct for the limitations/biases you observed?
    * _answer_
